# Design notes for “The Butler Did It”

## Concept

A murder mystery in reverse: You, the butler, have decided that your employer
needs to die. Your task is to do the deed without leaving any incriminating
evidence.

You have a checklist of tasks to accomplish as you move about the stately home
in which the game is set. As you do them, you must ensure that there are no
witnesses, and that any evidence is properly tidied up.

Each play-through contains a random selection of the following characteristics
of the murder plot:

* Means: How do you kill your employer? Poison in the wine, scorpion in the
  bed, electric shock, pushing off the balcony…
* Motive: Why are you doing this? And what evidence is there that needs to be
  covered up? Jealous lover (burn the love letters), being written out of the
  will (destroy the unsigned new version), an eye for an eye (ensure the crime
  they got away with isn’t found out), they know too much (this isn’t your
  first dastardly deed)…
* Opportunity: Orchestrate events so that you can carry out the plan—but have
  an alibi, too!

## Theme

The theme of Game Off 2022 is “Cliché”. The central cliché, of course, is right
there in the title: a murder mystery where “the butler did it”. Other featured clichés are, or may be:

* The notion of “getting away with murder”.
* Stock characters (the butler, the victim, other inhabitants and guests, the
  detective).
* Names of said characters, swerving between cliché and pastiche. The player
  character is assigned a random name from such staples as “Jeeves” and
  “Wadsworth”. The investigator who turns up could be “Achille Pinot”, “Miss
  Pyne” (too obscure? Oake, Alder, Harzel… ooh, Marplot?), “Willie Wong”, or
  “Angela Archer”.
* The investigative trio of “means, motive, and opportunity”, from police
  procedurals.
* Assorted *instances* of means, motive, and opportunity. (Though there should
  be some interestingly novel, or just plain weird, variations in there too,
  for the sake of interest and humour. Murder by fatal allergic reaction to a
  cute kitten!)
* The “to do” list that forms a key part of the game interface.
* Xs for eyes to show that someone is dead.

## Details

### Means

* Allergies. You sneak a kitten in, hoping that its meows won’t be heard, and
  you have to clean the fur off your clothes.
* Balcony fall. You sabotage the wooden rail by sawing through it. (Maybe
  pushing them off is an alternative?)
* Falling object—an anvil, naturally. You move slowly while carrying it, making
  it harder to get around without being witnessed.
* Poison in the wine. The difficulty is ensuring it’s the right wine glass.
* Scorpion in the bed. Don’t get stung yourself! (It won’t kill you, but the
  swelling is *very* incriminating.)
* Strangulation by piano wire garotte—avoid any telltale marks on your hands,
  and don’t let anyone see you fiddling with the piano in the conservatory!

### Motive

### Opportunity

### The investigation

Once the murder is committed, a sleuth turns up to assess the evidence. If you
avoided anything incriminating in all three categories, you get off scot-free!
If there’s one piece of evidence against you, you’re eventually let off, but
your good name is tarnished. Two pieces and you’re tried but acquitted, maybe
on appeal after an initial conviction. All three pieces and you’re nicked.

Maybe some evidence is especially damning?
